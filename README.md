# BSE-18-14-Final-Year-Project
This project focused on the development of machine-learning model for classifying cassava (leaves) diseases. The android app that was developed was intended to be used by small-scale farmers to take pictures of cassava leaves then the integrated machine-learning model returns the results of which disease is affecting the cassava leaves.
